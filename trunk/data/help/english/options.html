<h3>Options Window</h3>

<p align="justify">
Customize your search is carried out in the options window.
Open it may be either the main window using the <b>Options</b> button
</p>   

<img src="../../resources/images/OptionsButton.img" />

<p align="justify">
 or select the <b>Search - Options</b> item from the <a href="index.html?page=menu.html" target="_top">Main Menu</a>.
In this window, there are three groups of settings: check options, search options and additional options. 
Each of these groups is located on the corresponding tab.
</p>

<h4>Check Options</h4>

<p align="justify">
On the <b>Check</b> tag
</p>

<img src="files/CheckOptionsForm.png" />

<p align="justify">
there are following settings:
</p>

<ul>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Check on defect</b> - option specifies whether you want to check the images for defects. 
By default, this option is enabled.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Search image dupls</b> - determines the need to look for duplicate images. 
By default it is enabled.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Search rotated and mirror image dupls</b> - 	
Enabling this option allows you to search rotated and mirrored duplicate images.
It has to do more comparisons; therefore search is slowed down eight times. 
By default, this option is disabled. 
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Control image size</b> - if this options is enabled then the program take into account the size of pictures.
For example, the picture sizes 1024x768 and 800x600 will be different, even if they are to be shown the same thing.
By default, this option is disabled.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Control image type</b> - if this options is enabled then the program take into account the type of image in comparison.
For example, images in PNG and GIF formats will be different, regardless of their contents.
The default option is disabled.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Control image width/height ratio</b> - when you turn on this option, the program checks the ratio of width and height of images.
For example, this allows us not to compare the square and rectangular images among themselves, which greatly accelerates the search.
The degree of difference ratio of the width and height of images is governed by the parameter <b>Image width/height ratio precision</b>,
located on the Advanced tab options (see below).
By default, this option is enabled.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Threshold difference</b> -  when images are compared between each other, the standard deviation of brightness for each pair of images is calculated.
If this difference is below the value determined by this parameter, then the pictures are duplicates.
When setting this option at a low level, the program can not detect some of the duplicates.
If it is equal to zero then program will be able to find only fully identical images.
If he set too high, then increase the likelihood of false positives.
Also worth noting that the increase in this parameter leads to a slower speed of the algorithm and vice versa.
It can vary in the range from 0 to 15%.
By default, this parameter is equal to 5%.
This parameter is duplicated on the <a href="index.html?page=toolbar.html" target="_top">Tool Bar</a>.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Minimal image width/height</b> - sets the minimum width/height of images is necessary that they will be checked for the presence of duplicates.
This option allows you to exclude from the search too small images.
The default setting is 64. 
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Compare images from one path with one another</b> - when this option is enabled, the program compares one with another pictures that are located in the same <a href="index.html?page=paths.html" target="_top">search path</a>. 
Otherwise, the program will only compare the images from different search paths.
By default, this option is disabled.
 </p></li>
</ul><p align="justify">
Note that necessarily must be included either option <b>Check on defect</b>, either option <b>Search image dupls</b>.
</p>

<h4>Search Options</h4>

<h4>Advanced options</h4>

<p align="justify">
On the <b>Advanced</b> tag
</p>

<img src="files/AdvancedOptionsForm.png" />

<p align="justify">
there are following settings:
</p>

<ul>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Delete to recycle bin</b> - when you turn on this option, files will be removed in the recycle bin.
Otherwise, they will be deleted permanently.
By default, this option is enabled.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Remember mistakes</b> - option specifies whether you want to use when searching a database of false positives.
So the user during the processing of search results can mark false positives, for example, using the <b>Mark current result as a mistake</b> button
of the на <a href="index.html?page=preview.html" target="_top">Preview Panel</a>.
Then, when re-search more, these results will not be shown.  
By default, this option is enabled.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Image width/height ration precision</b> - option determines the accuracy
which must be respected by the ratio of width/height of the compared images.
It can be 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 or 1/64.
The default value is 1/32.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Compare threads count</b> - option specifies the number of threads of comparison, which are created when searching for duplicates.
It can take values Auto (number of threads is determined by the program), 1, ..., the number of processor cores in the system.
The default value is Auto.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Load thread count</b> - option specifies the number of threads of image loading, which are created when searching.
It can take values Auto (number of threads is determined by the program), 1, ..., the number of processor cores in the system.
The default value is Auto.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Normalized image size</b> - this parameter can be described as follows:
because images can be absolutely arbitrary size, then the correct comparison of their need to lead to a common denominator. 
To do this, all images are scaled to the same size and converted into 8-bit gray.
Then have these normalized images are compared with each other and stored in a database.
This option determines the size of these images.
The more normalized the size of images, the higher the accuracy of the program.
Adverse effects of this increase will be decrease of speed of the program,
and large requirements to the memory and the free disk space (to store the database of previously scanned images).
Can take the values 16x16, 32x32, 64x64 or 128x128.
The default value is 32х32.
 </p></li>
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Queue size of undo</b> - this parameter controls the maximum number of actions that the user can cancel a row.
This parameter can range from 0 to 16.
The default value is 10.
Note that in order to cancel the operation, the program needs to save its intermediate state and changes made during this operation.
For example, when deleting an image, there is no removal of images, but their hide and rename (received hidden temporary files are deleted later).
Naturally, these operations require additional resources and can slow down the program.
At low values of the queue size is performed saving of program resource.
In particular, if this parameter has a zero value, images will be removed directly without intermediate renaming and hiding, which speeds up the program.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Maximal count of results</b> - this parameter controls the maximum number of results that a program can be found in one search.
For example, if during the search program will be achieved this the number of results, the search will be automatically terminated.
This restriction is useful to save program resources allocated to the graphical representation of the results list.
By default, this value is 100000.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify">
<b>Width of ignored frame of image</b> - This parameter determines the width of frame of the image, the contents of which will be ignored during the comparison of images.
This option is relevant if you want to compare pictures with frames of different colors or small inscription on the edge.
By default, this value is 0 %.
 </p></li>
</ul>

Note: most users it is better not to change the settings on this tab.
